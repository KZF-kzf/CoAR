## 🔍 Overview

CoAR is a simple yet effective framework for injecting subject or style concepts into multi-modal autoregressive (AR) models without modifying any pretrained parameters.  
By leveraging a small set of **layer-wise multi-modal learnable tokens**, CoAR achieves high-quality, efficient customization for both subject-driven personalization and subject-style compositional generation.
